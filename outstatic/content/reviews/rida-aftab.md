Absolutely loved working with Catherine and Zarka for my home interiors. They managed to turn my house into a home and made it warm, inviting, interesting, and contemporary. They really delved into finding out who we were and what we wanted out of our space. Both the ladies are doing a fab job. They're super easy to talk to and always kept us in the loop. Super cooperative and great design sense. The hand over was on time as promised which I appreciate the most!
